43. LATS1 and LATS2 suppress breast cancer progression by maintaining cell identity and metabolic state [human]
(Submitter supplied) Deregulated activity of the LATS tumor suppressors has broad implications on cellular and tissue homeostasis. We examined the consequences of downregulation of either LATS1 or LATS2 in breast cancer. Consistent with their proposed tumor suppressive roles, expression of both paralogs is significantly downregulated in human breast cancer, and loss of either paralog accelerated mammary tumorigenesis in mice. more...

45. Mouse Myeloid panel on G-MDSCs from treated tumors
(Submitter supplied) Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) has revolutionized treatment in cancers that are naturally immunogenic by enabling infiltration of T cells into the tumor microenvironment (TME) and promoting cytotoxic signaling pathways. Tumors possessing complex immunosuppressive TME’s such as breast and pancreatic cancers present unique therapeutic obstacles as response rates to ICI remain low. Such tumors often recruit myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) whose functioning prohibits both T-cell activation and infiltration. more...

47. Development and Characterisation of Acquired Radioresistant Breast Cancer Cell Lines.
(Submitter supplied) Background: Radiotherapy plays an important role in the multimodal treatment of breast cancer. The response of a breast tumour to radiation depends not only on its innate radiosensitivity but also on tumour repopulation by cells that have developed radioresistance. Development of effective cancer treatments will require further molecular dissection of the processes that contribute to resistance.  Methods: Radioresistant cell lines were established by exposing MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and ZR-751 parental cells to increasing weekly doses of radiation. more...

49. Targeting 17q23 amplicon to overcome the resistance to anti-HER2 therapy in HER2+ breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Amplification of chromosome 17q23 is a frequent genomic event that occurs in ~ 11% of human breast cancers. The 17q23 amplification is enriched in HER2+ breast cancers, which is significantly correlated with poor clinical outcomes. Previous studies have identified the oncogenic phosphatase WIP1 gene in the amplicon, which functions as a master inhibitor in DNA damage response. While the possibility of any other protein-coding oncogenes in the WIP1-containing 17q23 amplicon was ruled out, our analysis of human breast cancer genomics uncovered an oncogenic microRNA gene, MIR21, in a majority of the WIP1-containing amplicons. more...

76. Function of HNRNPC in breast cancer cells by controlling the dsRNA-induced interferon response
(Submitter supplied) Elevated expression of RNA binding protein HNRNPC has been reported in cancer cells, while the essentialness and functions of HNRNPC in tumors were not clear. We showed that repression of HNRNPC in the breast cancer cells MCF7 and T47D inhibited cell proliferation and tumor growth. Our computational inference of the key pathways and extensive experimental investigations revealed that the cascade of interferon responses mediated by RIG-I was responsible for such tumor-inhibitory effect. more...

(Submitter supplied) Gene expression analysis on MEL-18-knockdown BT474 cells. MEL-18, a polycomb group protein and a member of the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), have suggested as a tumor suppressor in several cancer, including breast cancer. The results provides that the depletion of MEL-18 in HER2-positive breast cancer causes the activation of ErbB signaling pathway. We proposed that MEL-18 is a novel prognostic and therapeutic marker for HER2-positive breast cancer.

While CIN is a major driver of tumor evolution, its role in metastasis has not been established. Here we show that CIN promotes metastasis by sustaining a tumor-cell autonomous inflammatory response to cytosolic DNA. Errors in chromosome segregation create a preponderance of micronuclei whose envelopes frequently rupture exposing their DNA content to the cytosol. more...

174. Hypoxia is a Key Driver of Alternative Splicing in Human Breast Cancer Cells
(Submitter supplied) Adaptation to hypoxia, a hallmark feature of many tumors, is an important driver of cancer cell survival, proliferation and the development of resistance to chemotherapy. Hypoxia-induced stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) leads to transcriptional activation of a network of hypoxia target genes involved in angiogenesis, cell growth, glycolysis, DNA damage repair and apoptosis. Although the transcriptional targets of hypoxia have been characterized, the alternative splicing of transcripts that occurs during hypoxia and the roles they play in oncogenesis are much less understood. more...

175. Regulation of NRF2 signaling by O-GlcNAcylation of KEAP1
(Submitter supplied) O-GlcNAcylation is an essential, nutrient-sensitive post-translational modification, but its biochemical and phenotypic effects remain incompletely understood. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the global transcriptional response to perturbations in O-GlcNAcylation. Unexpectedly, many transcriptional effects of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) inhibition were due to the activation of NRF2, the master regulator of redox stress tolerance. more...

176. Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate treatment targets the copper transporter ATP7A in cisplatin-resistant breast cancer TM and cisplatin sensitize resistant breast cancer.
(Submitter supplied) Chemotherapy resistance presents a major hurdle for cancer treatment. We proposed to identify the molecular changes through which breast cancer cells evolve resistance to conventional treatment, here cisplatin, so targeted therapy can be developed. Candidate approach RNAi screening was combined with cisplatin treatment in order to identify molecular pathways conferring survival advantages. The screening identified ATP7A, a copper transport ATPase responsible for the intercellular movement and sequestering of cisplatin, as a therapeutic target. more...

178. ATM signalling and autophagy cooperate in the regulation of breast cancer stem-like phenotype: a transcriptional profile
(Submitter supplied) In the last past decades, it has been focused the attention on a new emerging concept in the field of cancer research, such as the involvement of a small fraction of cells within many solid tumours that seem to be responsible for tumour initiation, maintenance and, more importantly, for drug resistance, called cancer stem cells (CSCs). According to this hypothesis, this pool of cells could be distinguished from all the other tumour cells, not only because they have different properties, such as the ability to self-renew or to differentiate into different tumour types, but also because they grow in a specific microenvironment, suggesting a different metabolic requirement; understanding this concept and the signalling pathways involved could be be extremely important for the development of new specific therapeutic drugs. more...

However, duration of its effect is very short for clinical use. Here, we developed the chemically modified ERAP using stapling methods (stERAP; stapled ERAP) to improve duration of their antitumor effects. more...

(Submitter supplied) The tumor suppressor PTEN is frequently inactivated in breast and other cancers; yet, germ-line mutations in this gene induce non-malignant hamartomas, indicating dependency on additional cooperating events.  Here we show that most tumors derived from conditional deletion of mouse Pten in mammary epithelium are highly differentiated and lack transplantable tumor initiating cells (TICs) capable of seeding new tumors following orthotopic injection of FACS-sorted or tumorsphere cells. more...

However, the gene targets and cell signalling pathway regulated by mutant PIK3CA, Her2 and both of PIK3CA and Her2 have not been well studied. We established stable cell models through transfecting mutant PIK3CA, Her2 and both mutant PIK3CA and Her2 into MCF10A cells and performed Affymetrix microarray to identify downstream target genes controlled by either mutant PIK3CA, Her2 or both PIK3CA and Her2.

(Submitter supplied) CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is an important epigenetic regulator that has been implicated in multiple cellular processes including growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Deletion or mutation of CTCF is associated with human breast carcinogenesis. However, the exact role that CTCF plays in breast cancer has not been fully elucidated. To investigate the biological functions of CTCF in breast cancer and the underlying mechanisms, we carried out microarray analysis comparing the gene expression of CTCF overexpressing and control MDA-MB-231 cells to screen the possible target genes and pathways that CTCF regulated.

(Submitter supplied) The Runx1 transcription factor is essential for hematopoietic differentiation and mutations underlie various leukemias. Here we demonstrate a role for Runx1 in the MCF10 cell series model of breast cancer progression. The highest level of Runx1 that occurs in normal like mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A) is decreased in tumorigenic (MCF10AT1) and metastatic (MCF10CA1a) breast cancer cells. We show that depletion of Runx1 in MCF10A cells results in striking changes in cell morphology and induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via several signaling pathways. more...

Here we challenge this conclusion by showing that it failed to account for possible crosstalk between EMT and non-EMT cells that promotes dissemination of non-EMT cells. In breast cancer models, EMT cells induce increased metastasis of weakly metastatic, non-EMT tumor cells in a paracrine manner in part by non-cell autonomous activation of the GLI transcription factor. more...

(Submitter supplied) A long noncoding RNA (Lnc-BM) mediates JAK2 activity in 231-BM cells treated with OSM. Emerging evidence has shown that the effect of JAK2 is mainly mediated by three downstream signaling pathways including the AKT, MAPK, and STAT1/3/5 pathways. To determine the signaling pathways that are regulated by Lnc-BM, we performed gene expression microarray analysis on cells with Lnc-BM depletion or JAK2 KO and compared them to their corresponding controls following OSM stimulation.

Cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) is a transcriptional regulator of several oncogenic pathways. Expression levels of CDK8 and ERα are inversely correlated in breast cancers suggesting a functional association between CDK8 and ER. CDK8 inhibition by selective small-molecule inhibitors, by shRNA knockdown or by CRISPR-Cas9 knockout suppressed estrogen-induced transcription, with no significant effects on ERα protein expression or phosphorylation. more...

The mechanisms involved in alcohol's oncogenic effects are  unknown, but it has been speculated that they may be mediated by acetaldehyde. Here, we use the immortalized normal human epithelial breast cell line MCF-12A to determine whether short- or long-term exposure to ethanol or to acetaldehyde, using in vivo compatible ethanol concentrations, induces their oncogenic transformation and/or the acquisition of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). more...

209. Regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) expression and secretion by LIM and SH3 protein (LASP1)
(Submitter supplied) The process of tumor invasion requires degradation of extracellular matrix by proteolytic enzymes. Cancer cells form protrusive invadopodia, which produce and release matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to degrade the basement membrane and thereby allowing metastasis. We investigated the effect of LASP1, a newly identified protein in invadopodia, on expression, secretion and activation of MMPs in invasive breast tumor cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Cytoplasmic localization of proline, glutamic acid, leucine-rich protein 1 (PELP1) is observed in ∼40% of women with invasive breast cancer. In mouse models, PELP1 overexpression in the mammary gland leads to premalignant lesions and eventually mammary tumors. In preliminary clinical studies, cytoplasmic localization of PELP1 was seen in 36% of women at high risk of developing breast cancer. Here, we investigated whether cytoplasmic PELP1 signaling promotes breast cancer initiation in models of immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). more...

218. Regulation of miRNA-29c and its downstream pathways in preneoplastic progression of triple negative breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Little is understood about the early molecular drivers of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), making the identification of women at risk and development of targeted therapy for prevention significant challenges. By sequencing a TNBC cell line-based breast cancer progression model we have found that miRNA-29c is progressively lost during TNBC tumorigenesis.   In support of the tumor suppressive role of miRNA 29c, we found that low levels predict poor overall patient survival and, conversely, that ectopic expression of miRNA-29c in preneoplastic cell models inhibits growth. more...

There is evidence to indicate that Twist expression plays a role in breast tumor formation and metastasis, but the role of Twist in dysregulating pathways that drive the metastatic cascade is unclear. Importantly, the genes and pathways dysregulated by Twist in cell lines and mouse models have not been validated against data obtained from patient samples. more...

242. miRNA transcriptome profiling of spheroid-enriched cells with cancer stem cell properties in human breast MDA-MB-231 cell line.
(Submitter supplied) cancer spheroid has been widely used as in vitro model of cancer stem cells (CSCs), yet little is known about their phenotypic characteristics and microRNAs (miRNAs) expression profiles. The objectives of this research were to evaluate the phenotypic characteristics of MDA-MB-231 spheroid-enriched cells for their CSCs properties and also to determine their miRNAs expression profile. Similar to our previously published MCF-7 spheroid, MDA-MB-231 spheroid also showed typical CSCs characteristics namely self-renewability, expression of putative CSCs-related surface markers and enhancement of drug resistance. more...

(Submitter supplied) Although clinically associated with severe intellectual disability, West syndrome, Dandy-Walker malformation, and syndactyly, the biological function of FOXK2 remains poorly explored. Here we report that FOXK2 acts as a transcription repressor. Strikingly, FOXK2 interacts with multiple transcription corepressor complexes including NCoR/SMRT, SIN3A, NuRD, and REST/CoREST. FOXK2 assembles these transcription programs to repress a cohort of genes including HIF1 and EZH2 and to regulate several signaling pathways including the hypoxic response that is critically implicated in tumor development and progression. more...

Here, we report the development of structurally novel estrogens with favorable target tissue-selective estrogenic activity. Through a process of structural alteration of the hormone estradiol that preserves essential chemical and physical features of estradiol but greatly moderates its binding affinity for the estrogen receptors (ERs), we obtained Pathway Preferential Estrogens (PaPEs) capable of having interaction with ER that is sufficient to activate the extranuclear-initiated signaling pathway preferentially over the direct nuclear-initiated pathway. more...

We therefore examined markers of DER in the breast, adipose tissue, and serum. Nineteen overweight or obese women at moderately increased risk of breast cancer (lifetime risk, 1 in 6 to 1 in 3) ages between 35 and 45 were randomly allocated to DER [liquid diet, 3,656 kJ/d (864 kcal/d); n = 10] or asked to continue their normal eating patterns (n = 9) for one menstrual cycle. more...

275. Molecular features of subtype-specific progression from ductal carcinoma in situ to invasive breast cancer [miRNA data]
(Submitter supplied) Breast cancer consists of at least five main molecular “intrinsic” subtypes, which are reflected in both pre-invasive and invasive disease. Although previous studies have suggested that many of the molecular features of invasive breast cancer are established early, it is unclear what mechanisms drive progression, and whether the mechanisms of progression are dependent or independent of subtype. We have generated mRNA, miRNA and DNA copy number profiles from a total of 59 in situ lesions and 85 invasive tumors, in order to comprehensively identify those genes, signaling pathways, processes, and cell types that are involved in breast cancer progression. more...

277. Ridaforolimus (MK-8669) synergizes with Dalotuzumab (MK-0646) in hormone-sensitive breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Introduction: Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) represents a key downstream intermediate for a myriad of oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases. In the case of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway, the mTOR complex (mTORC1) mediates IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R)-induced estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) phosphorylation/activation and leads to increased proliferation and growth in breast cancer cells. As a result, the prevalence of mTOR inhibitors combined with hormonal therapy has increased in recent years. Conversely, activated mTORC1 provides negative feedback regulation of IGF signaling via insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1/2 serine phosphorylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Thus, the IGF pathway may provide escape (e.g. de novo or acquired resistance) from mTORC1 inhibitors. It is therefore plausible that combined inhibition of mTORC1 and IGF-1R for select subsets of ER-positive breast cancer patients presents as a viable therapeutic option.   Methods: Using hormone-sensitive breast cancer cells stably transfected with the aromatase gene (MCF-7/AC-1), works presented herein describe the in vitro and in vivo antitumor efficacy of the following compounds: dalotuzumab (DALO; “MK-0646”; anti-IGF-1R antibody), ridaforolimus (RIDA; “MK-8669”; mTORC1 small molecule inhibitor) and letrozole (“LET”, aromatase inhibitor).   Results: With the exception of MK-0646, all single agent and combination treatment arms effectively inhibited xenograft tumor growth, albeit to varying degrees. Correlative tissue analyses revealed MK-0646 alone and in combination with LET induced insulin receptor alpha A (InsR-A) isoform upregulation (both mRNA and protein expression), thereby further supporting a triple therapy approach.   Conclusion: These data provide preclinical rationalization towards the combined triple therapy of LET plus MK-0646 plus MK-8669 as an efficacious anti-tumor strategy for ER-positive breast tumors.

306. Insulin receptor substrate adaptor proteins mediate prognostic gene expression profiles in breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Therapies targeting the type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) have not been developed with predictive biomarkers to identify tumors with receptor activation.  We have previously shown that the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) adaptor proteins are necessary for linking IGF1R to downstream signaling pathways and the malignant phenotype in breast cancer cells.  The purpose of this study was to identify gene expression profiles downstream of IGF1R and its two adaptor proteins. more...

307. The effect of knockdown Abl kinases on breast cancer cells' global transcriptome
(Submitter supplied) To gain insight into the signaling pathway(s) required for ABL1/ABL2-dependent bone metastasis, we evaluated the consequences of single or double inactivation of ABL1 and ABL2 on the transcriptome of breast cancer cells. Double ABL1/ABL2 knockdown was required to decrease the levels of p-CrKL by more than 90%, indicative of inactivation of the endogenous ABL kinases. To examine the consequences of depleting the ABL kinases on the transcriptome of metastatic breast cancer cells we employed next generation sequencing (RNAseq) analysis. more...

308. HER2 and EGFR dependent activation of RalA in breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Activated HER2 and EGFR stimulate the Ras small GTPases, which in turn primarily activate the MAPK, PI3K-Akt and RalGEF-Ral pathways.  While activation of the MAPK and PI3K-Akt pathways downstream of HER2 and EGFR promote mammary tumorigenesis, little is known regarding the role of the RalGEF-Ral pathway.  RalGEFs convert the small GTPases RalA and RalB to an active GTP-bound state.  Of the two proteins, only activated RalA is transforming, while RalB is more important for cell motility, and hence we investigated the role of RalA in HER2-overexpressing and EGFR-positive breast cancer. more...

309. RAS signalling through PI3-Kinase controls cell migration via modulation of Reelin expression
(Submitter supplied) RAS signalling through Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-Kinase) has been shown to have an essential role in tumour initiation and maintenance. RAS also regulates cell motility and tumor invasiveness, but the role of direct RAS binding to PI3-Kinase in this remains uncertain. Here, we provide evidence that disruption of RAS interaction with PI3-Kinase p110adecreases cell motility and prevents activation of Rac GTPase. more...

Epigenetic modifications of DNA and histones contribute to chromatin structure that results in the activation or repression of gene expression. Several epigenetic pathways have been shown to be highly deregulated in cancer cells. Targeting specific histone modifications represents a viable strategy to prevent oncogenic transformation, tumor growth or metastasis. more...

(Submitter supplied) Tumor core biopsies were obtained at baseline and after brief-exposure to single-agent trastuzumab from patients enrolled on the 03-311 trial.   Gene expression profiling was conducted on these tumor biopsies to identify signatures of response to preoperative therapy. This study was initiated to identify biomarkers of response to preoperative trastuzumab-conotaining therapy. We performed transcriptional profiling of patient tumor biopsies obtained at baseline and post brief-exposure to trastuzumab to test the hypothesis that transcriptional changes upon brief-exposure to therapy can provide an early readout of subsequent response.

317. HER2 signaling drives DNA anabolism and proliferation through SRC-3 phosphorylation and E2F1-regulated genes
(Submitter supplied) Approximately 20% of early-stage breast cancers display amplification or overexpression of the ErbB2/HER2 oncogene, conferring poor prognosis and resistance to endocrine therapy. Targeting HER2+ tumors with trastuzumab or the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor lapatinib significantly improves survival, yet tumor resistance and progression of metastatic disease can develop over time. While the mechanisms of cytosolic HER2 signaling are well studied, nuclear signaling components and gene regulatory networks that bestow therapeutic resistance and limitless proliferative potential are incompletely understood. more...

349. Estrogen Receptor Beta Impacts Hormone-Induced Alternative mRNA Splicing in Breast Cancer Cells
(Submitter supplied) Estrogens play an important role in breast cancer (BC) development and progression, where the two isoforms of the estrogen receptor (ERα and ERβ) are generally co-expressed and mediate the effects of these hormones in cancer cells. ERβ has been suggested to exert an antagonist role toward the oncogenic activities of ERα, and for this reason it is considered an oncosuppressor. As clinical evidence regarding a prognostic role for this receptor subtype in hormone-responsive BC is still limited and conflicting, more knowledge is required on the biological functions of ERβ in cancer cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Aromatase inhibitors are first-line postmenopausal agents for estrogen receptor alpha (ERa)-positive breast cancer. However, there is considerable response heterogeneity and women frequently relapse. Estrogen deprivation does not completely arrest ERa activity, and transactivation of the unliganded receptor may continue through cross-talk with growth factor pathways. In contrast with aromatase inhibitors, the selective ER downregulator fulvestrant also abrogates ligand-independent ERa activity. more...

358. Dynamics of gene expression changes in epithelial and mesenchymal HMLER cell lines transitioning from suspension 3D culture to adhesion cultures
(Submitter supplied) In order to metastasize, few cells need to detach from the primary tumor, and transition through the circulation to distant sites to establish new solid tumor metastases. The gene expression changes occurring between these transitions are poorly understood, and controversial findings have been reported regarding transitions between epithelial (E) and mesenchymal (M) cell states. To model the metastasis process in vitro, here we examined the dynamics of gene expression changes and respective cell fates that are occurring in cells that are transitioning from adhesion culture to suspension 3D culture (mammospheres) and back to adhesion culture in vitro. more...

373. PI3K inhibition results in enhanced estrogen receptor function and dependence in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Activating mutations of PIK3CA are the most frequent genomic alterations in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast tumors and selective PI3Kα inhibitors are in clinical development. The activity of these agents, however, is not homogenous and only a fraction of patients bearing PIK3CA-mutant ER-positive tumors benefit from single agent administration. Searching for mechanisms of resistance, we observed that suppression of PI3K signaling with different agents results in induction of ER-dependent transcriptional activity as demonstrated by changes in expression in genes containing ER binding sites, enhanced ER transcription and increased occupancy by the ER of promoter regions of upregulated genes. more...

374. Gene expression study of MCF7/tet-off clones expressing different HER2 isoforms
(Submitter supplied) HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor causally involved in cancer. A subgroup of breast cancer patients with particularly poor clinical outcome expresses a heterogeneous collection of HER2 carboxy-terminal fragments (CTFs). However, since the CTFs lack the extracellular domain that drives dimerization and subsequent activation of full-length HER2, they are in principle expected to be inactive. Here we present evidence that at low expression levels one of these fragments, 611-CTF, activated multiple signaling pathways because of its unanticipated ability to constitutively homodimerize. more...

377. Regulation of gene expression by glucose metabolism in mammary cell lines
(Submitter supplied) Reprogramming of cancer cell metabolism toward aerobic glycolysis, i.e. the Warburg effect, is a hallmark of cancer; according to current views, the rationale for selecting such energy-inefficient metabolism is the need to increase cellular biomass to sustain production of daughter cells and proliferation. In this view, metabolic reprogramming is considered as a simple phenotypic endpoint that occurs as a consequence of signal transduction mechanisms, including oncogene-driven nutrient uptake and metabolic rewiring. more...

To identify potential molecular players in the tumor suppressor responses,  we performed global gene expression analyses. To determine which genes were regulated by TGF-beta in this tumor model in vivo,  we performed gene expression arrays on tumors derived from xenografts of M3 cells with and without expression of a dominant negative TGF-beta receptor to block activity of endogenous TGF-beta.

Here we generated and analyzed knockin mice that express a series of human cancer-derived mutant alleles of PTEN in either stromal or tumor cell compartments of mammary glands. We find that cell non-autonomous tumor suppression by Pten in stromal fibroblasts strictly requires activation of P-Akt signaling, whereas cell autonomous tumor suppression in epithelial tumor cells is independent of overt canonical pathway activation These findings expose distinct Akt-dependent and independent tumor suppressor functions of PTEN in stromal fibroblasts and tumor cells, respectively, that can be used to guide clinical care of breast cancer patients

(Submitter supplied) Why breast cancers become resistant to tamoxifen despite continued expression of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and what factors are responsible for high HER2 expression in these tumors remains an enigma. HOXB7 ChIP analysis followed by validation showed that HOXB7 physically interacts with ERα, and that the HOXB7-ERα complex enhances transcription of many ERα target genes including HER2. Investigating strategies for controlling HOXB7, our studies revealed that MYC, stabilized via phosphorylation mediated by EGFR-HER2 signaling, inhibits transcription of miRNA-196a, a HOXB7 repressor. more...

407. Exosome Transfer from Stromal to Breast Cancer Cells Regulates Therapy Resistance Pathways [set 2]
(Submitter supplied) Stromal communication with cancer cells can influence treatment response. We show that stromal and breast cancer (BrCa) cells utilize paracrine and juxtacrine signaling to drive chemotherapy and radiation resistance. Upon heterotypic interaction, exosomes are transferred from stromal to BrCa cells. RNA within exosomes, which are largely non-coding transcripts and transposable elements, stimulates the pattern recognition receptor RIG-I to activate STAT1-dependent anti-viral signaling. more...

410. Analysis of exosome RNA from co-culture of cancer cell and stroma cell
(Submitter supplied) How stroma communicates with cancer to influence treatment response is poorly understood. We show that stromal fibroblasts protect breast cancer (BrCa) against radiation and chemotherapy through an exosome-mediated anti-viral pathway and NOTCH3. Stroma increases RAB27B and transfers exosomes to BrCa. RNA within exosomes, comprised largely of non-coding transcripts and transposable elements, stimulates the pattern recognition receptor RIG-I through a 5’-triphosphate motif to activate STAT1. more...

411. PMCA2 Regulates HER2 Expression, Cell-Surface  Localization and Signaling, and Promotes HER2-  Mediated Breast Cancer
(Submitter supplied) In the normal breast, PMCA2 transports calcium into milk. It is also  upregulated in breast cancer cells and high tumor levels predict increased  mortality in patients. In this study, we examined interactions between PMCA2  and HER2. We find that PMCA2 and a scaffolding protein, NHERF1, interact  together with HER2 in specific membrane domains protruding from the surface of  breast cancer cells. Knocking down PMCA2 or NHERF1 increases intracellular  calcium and leads to the ubiquitination, endocytosis and degradation of HER2  after receptor activation. more...

(Submitter supplied) Tamoxifen is a non-steroidal anti-estrogenic drug widely used for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer in women; however, there is evidence that tamoxifen is hepatocarcinogenic in rats, but not in mice. Additionally, it has been reported that tamoxifen may cause non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in humans and experimental animals. The goals of the present study were to (i) investigate the mechanisms of the resistance of mice to tamoxifen-induced hepatocarcinogenesis, and (ii) clarify effects of tamoxifen on NAFLD-associated liver injury. more...

(Submitter supplied) To investigate the impact of combined Rb and p53 loss in mammary tumorigenesis, we used transgenic  and viral approaches to delete Rb and p53 floxed alleles specifically in the mouse mammary epithelium.  Although MMTV-Cre (NLST) targets stem/bi-potent progenitors in the mammary gland, a subset of MMTV-Cre:Rbf/f;p53f/f mice developed non-mammary tumors. Thus, freshly isolated primary mammary epithelial cells from these animals were transplanted into the mammary fat pads of immunodeficient mice and monitored for tumor formation. more...

417. Breast cancer cell lines treated with eribulin and paclitaxel
(Submitter supplied) Eribulin mesylate is a synthetic macrocyclic ketone analog of the marine sponge natural product halichondrin B. Eribulin is a mechanistically unique inhibitor of microtubule dynamics, leading to inhibition of microtubule growth in the absence of effects on microtubule shortening at microtubule plus ends, and formation of nonproductive tubulin aggregates. In this study, we investigated whether selective signal pathways were associated with eribulin activity compared to paclitaxel, which stabilizes microtubules, based on gene expression profiling of cell line panels of breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancer in vitro.

418. Expression data from menadione, PERK inhibitor, or control-treated HMLE-shGFP and HMLE-Twist human mammary epithelial cells
(Submitter supplied) Malignant carcinomas that recur following therapy are typically de-differentiated and multi-drug resistant (MDR). De-differentiated cancer cells acquire MDR by upregulating reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging enzymes and drug efflux pumps, but how these genes are upregulated in response to de-differentiation is not known. Here, we examine this question by using global transcriptional profiling to identify ROS-induced genes that are already upregulated in de-differentiated cells, even in the absence of oxidative damage. more...

438. Over-expression of miR-146a in basal-like breast cancer cells confers enhanced tumorigenic potential in association with altered p53 status
(Submitter supplied) The tumor suppressor p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancers, mutated in 25-30% of breast cancers. However, mutation rates differ according to breast cancer subtype, being more prevalent in aggressive estrogen receptor (ER) negative tumors, basal-like and HER2 amplified subtypes. This heterogeneity suggests that p53 may function differently across breast cancer subtypes. We used RNAi-mediated p53 knockdown (KD) and antagomir-mediated KD of microRNAs to study how gene expression and cellular response to p53 loss differ in luminal vs. more...

(Submitter supplied) Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive clinical phenotype, and accounts for 15% to 20% of all breast cancers. The molecular determinants of malignant cell behaviors in TNBC remain largely unknown. We find that the AP-1 transcription factor component, Fra-1, is overexpressed in basal-like breast tumors, and its expression level has high prognostic significance. Depletion of Fra-1 or its heterodimeric partner c-Jun inhibits the proliferative and invasive phenotypes in TNBC cells. more...

441. Insights into the invasiveness of triple negative breast cancer from genome-wide profiling of transcription factor AP-1 (ChIP-seq)
(Submitter supplied) Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive clinical phenotype, and accounts for 15% to 20% of all breast cancers. The molecular determinants of malignant cell behaviors in TNBC remain largely unknown. We find that the AP-1 transcription factor component, Fra-1, is overexpressed in basal-like breast tumors, and its expression level has high prognostic significance. Depletion of Fra-1 or its heterodimeric partner c-Jun inhibits the proliferative and invasive phenotypes in TNBC cells. more...

446. Cell-type restricted activity of hnRNPM promotes breast cancer metastasis via regulating alternative splicing
(Submitter supplied) Tumor metastasis remains the major cause of cancer-related death, but its molecular basis is still not well understood. Here we uncovered a splicing-mediated pathway that is essential for breast cancer metastasis. We show that the RNA-binding protein hnRNPM promotes breast cancer metastasis by activating the switch of alternative splicing that occurs during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Genome-wide deep sequencing analysis suggests that hnRNPM potentiates TGFb signaling and identifies CD44 as a key downstream target of hnRNPM. more...

(Submitter supplied) The erythropoietin (EPO) hormone induces red blood cell production and its recombinant form is the most prescribed drug for the treatment of anemia, including that arising in cancer patients. Based on randomized trials showing that EPO administration to cancer patients result in a decreased survival, we investigated the impact of EPO modulation on tumorigenesis. Using genetically engineered mouse models of breast cancer we found that EPO promoted tumorigenesis by activating JAK/STAT signaling specifically in breast tumor initiating cells (TICs) and promoting their self-renewal. more...

475. Integrative Analyses of Gene Expression and DNA Methylation Profiles in a Breast Cancer Cell Line Model of Tamoxifen-Resistance Indicate a Crucial Role of Cells with Stem-like Properties
(Submitter supplied) Purpose: Development of resistance to tamoxifen is an important clinical issue in the treatment of patients with breast cancer. Tamoxifen resistance may be the result of the acquisition of epigenetic regulation such as DNA methylation within breast cancer cells resulting in changed mRNA expression of genes being pivotal for estrogen dependent growth. Alternatively, tamoxifen resistance may be due to selection of preexisting resistant cells, which may exhibit cancer stem-like characteristics or a combination of the two mechanisms. more...

490. Human breast cancer associated fibroblasts exhibit subtype specific gene expression profiles
(Submitter supplied) Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease for which prognosis and treatment strategies are largely governed by the receptor status (estrogen, progesterone and Her2-neu) of the tumor cells.  Gene expression profiling of whole breast tumors further stratifies breast cancer into several molecular subtypes which also co-segregate with the receptor status of the tumor cells.  We postulated that cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the tumor stroma may exhibit subtype specific gene expression profiles and thus contribute to the biology of the disease in a subtype specific manner. more...

517. The ShcA PTB Domain Functions as a Biological Sensor of Phospho-tyrosine Signaling During Breast Cancer Progression
(Submitter supplied) The ShcA adaptor possesses two phosphotyrosine binding motifs, which include an SH2 and a PTB domain. In the majority of  cases, ShcA utilizes its PTB domain to engage activated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). To establish the mportance of this domain during mammary tumorigenesis, we employed a ShcA mutant (R175Q) that no longer binds phospho-tyrosine residues via its PTB domain. We demonstrate that the ShcR175Q mutant delays mammary tumor  onset n MMTV/MT transgenic animals. more...

518. RB pathway deregulation promotes invasion and disease progression in a mouse model of MYC-overexpressing mammary tumorigenesis
(Submitter supplied) Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease that is categorized into distinct tumor subtypes based on specific molecular attributes, which ultimately influence therapeutic options. Unlike ER+ and/or HER2+ cancers that are subject to specific targeted therapies, triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) do not express these receptors, which leaves patients with limited treatment options. Thus, significant focus has been placed on identifying molecular attributes of basal-like disease that could be used to develop and/or direct novel treatment regimens. more...

546. Cancer-produced metabolites of 5-lipoxygenase induce tumor-evoked Bregs via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha
(Submitter supplied) Breast cancer cells facilitate distant metastasis through the induction of immunosuppressive regulatory B cells, designated tBregs. We report here that, to do this, breast cancer cells produce metabolites of the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway such as leukotriene B4 (LTB4) to activate the proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) in B cells. Inactivation of LTB4 signaling or genetic deficiency of PPARalpha in B cells blocks the generation of tBregs and thereby abrogates lung metastasis in mice with established breast cancer. more...

547. Mechanotransduction regulates adipose estrogen output and its impact on tumor cell growth
(Submitter supplied) Adipose stromal cells (ASCs) are the primary source of local estrogens in adipose tissue, aberrant production of which promotes estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer.  Here we show that extracellular matrix (ECM) rigidity and cell contractility are two opposing determinants for estrogen output of ASCs.  Using synthetic ECMs and elastomeric micropost arrays with tunable rigidity, we find that increasing matrix compliance induces transcription of aromatase, a rate-limiting enzyme in estrogen biosynthesis. more...

(Submitter supplied) MCF7 breast cancer cells are a luminal-type breast cancer with moderate native levels of SIM2s.  To determine effects of SIM2s on tumor progression, cells were stably transduced with SIM2si shRNA to knockdown expression, inducing an EMT effect.  Microarray analysis was performed to determine genetic pathways involved in this phenotype. The coordination of cellular metabolism is a key factor in the progression of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). more...

549. MicroRNA-182-5p targets a network of genes involved in DNA repair
(Submitter supplied) MicroRNAs are non-coding regulators of gene expression, which act by repressing protein translation and/or degrading mRNA. Many have been shown to drive tumorigenesis in cancer, but functional studies to understand their mode of action are typically limited to single target genes. In this study we use synthetic biotinylated miRNA to pull down endogenous targets of miR-182. We identified over 1000 genes as potential targets of miR-182, most of which have a known function in pathways underlying tumour biology. more...

550. PML regulates PPAR signaling and fatty acid oxidation in breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Cancer cells exhibit an aberrant metabolism which facilitates more efficient production of biomass, and hence tumor growth and progression. The genetic cues modulating this metabolic switch remain largely undetermined, however. Here we identify a metabolic function for PML which reveals an unexpected role for this bona-fide tumor suppressor in pro-survival activity in breast cancer. We find that PML acts as both a negative regulator of PGC1A acetylation and as a potent activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling and fatty acid oxidation (FAO). more...

(Submitter supplied) Targeting the estrogen signaling pathway has proved to be of great value in the treatment of human breast cancer. Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), is the most widely used antiestrogen. However, only 40-50% of patients with estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer benefit from tamoxifen treatment and 30-50% acquire resistance and the disease progresses. Continuous treatment with conventional therapy may contribute to cancer progression in recurring cancers through the accumulation of drug resistant cancer progenitors. more...

We show that the DNA damage response (DDR) induced by ionizing radiation (IR) is coordinated in breast cancer  cells by selective mRNA translation mediated by high levels of translation initiation factor eIF4G1. Increased expression of eIF4G1,  common in breast cancers, was found to selectively increase translation of mRNAs involved in cell survival and the DDR, preventing  autophagy and apoptosis (Survivin, HIF1α, XIAP), promoting cell cycle arrest (GADD45a, p53, ATRIP, Chk1) and DNA repair (53BP1,  BRCA1/2, PARP, Rfc2-5, ATM, MRE-11, others). more...

581. HSF1 drives a transcriptional program distinct from heat shock to support highly malignant human cancers [ChIP-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Heat-Shock Factor 1 (HSF1), master regulator of the heat-shock response, facilitates malignant transformation, cancer cell survival and proliferation in model systems. The common assumption is that these effects are mediated through regulation of heat-shock protein (HSP) expression. However, the transcriptional network that HSF1 coordinates directly in malignancy and its relationship to the heat-shock response have never been defined. more...

582. Interplay between AP-1 and ERalpha in regulating gene expression and proliferation networks in breast cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that plays an important role in breast cancer. Estrogen-dependent gene regulation by ERalpha can be mediated by interaction with other DNA-binding proteins, such as activator protein-1 (AP-1). The nature of such interactions in mediating the estrogen response in breast cancer cells remains unclear. Here we show that knockdown of c-Fos, a component of the transcription factor AP-1, attenuates the expression of 37% of all estrogen-regulated genes, suggesting that AP-1 is a fundamental factor for ERalpha-mediated transcription. more...

(Submitter supplied) ERα17p is a synthetic peptide corresponding to the sequence P295LMIKRSKKNSLALSLT311 of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and initially synthesized to mimic its calmodulin binding site. ERα17p was subsequently found to elicit estrogenic responses in E2-deprived ERα-positive breast cancer cells, increasing proliferation and E2-dependent gene transcription.  Surprisingly, in E2-supplemented media, ERα17p induced apoptosis and modified the actin network, influencing thereby cell motility. more...

(Submitter supplied) Triple Negative Breast cancer accounts for some of the most aggressive types of breast cancer. By interrogating clinical datasets, we found that the activities of p63 and Hypoxia-Inducible-Factors (HIFs), two master regulators of the invasive and metastatic cancer cell phenotype are  linked in TNBC through the p63-target Sharp1. Mechanistically, Sharp1 promotes HIF-1α/HIF-2α proteasomal degradation by serving as HIFs presenting factor to the proteasome independently from oxygen levels and prior ubiquitination. more...

589. Mechanisms and pathways of bone metastasis: challenges and pitfalls of performing molecular research on patient samples
(Submitter supplied) The molecular mechanisms underlying the development of bone metastases in breast cancer remain unclear. Disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) in the bone marrow of breast cancer patients are commonly identified, even in early stage disease, but their potential to initiate metastases is not known. The mechanism whereby DTCs become overt metastatic tumour cells (MTCs) is therefore, an area of considerable interest. more...

590. MCF7 Cells: Control siRNA -E2 vs. Control siRNA +E2, Control siRNA -E2 vs. PES1 siRNA -E2,Control siRNA -E2 vs. PES1 siRNA +E2
(Submitter supplied) The initiation of breast cancer is associated with increased expression of tumor-promoting estrogen receptor α (ERα) protein and decreased expression of tumor-suppressive ERβ protein. However, the mechanism underlying this process is unknown. Here we show that Pescadillo/PES1, an estrogen-inducible protein that is over-expressed in breast cancer, can regulate the balance between ERα and ERβ. PES1 enhances transcriptional activity of ERα and reduces that of ERβ, and modulates many estrogen-responsive genes. more...

Metformin exhibits anti-proliferative and anti-neoplastic effects associated with inhibition of mTORC1, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. We provide the first genome-wide analysis of translational targets of canonical mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin and PP242) and metformin, revealing that metformin controls gene expression at the level of mRNA translation to an extent comparable to that of canonical mTOR inhibitors. more...

(Submitter supplied) Crosstalk and complexity within signaling pathways has limited our ability to devise rational strategies for using network biology to treat human disease. This is particularly problematic in cancer where oncogenes that drive or maintain the tumorigenic state alter the normal flow of molecular information within signaling networks that control growth, survival and death. Understanding the architecture of oncogenic signaling pathways, and how these networks are re-wired by ligands or drugs, could provide opportunities for the specific targeting of oncogene-driven tumors. more...

615. Time-course effect of estradiol and estradiol-BSA on early gene expression in MCF-7 cells
(Submitter supplied) Estrogens have been reported to activate several processes via membrane binding to either classic estrogen receptors (ERs) or GPR30. We have used either estradiol or BSA-conjugated estradiol in order to initiate membrane-initiated actions and ICI 172,780 (ICI) or G15 to explore ER- and GPR30-related transcription. Our results show that the majority of G15-inhibited transcription is depending on ERs, as it is also inhibited by ICI. more...

617. Alterations in tumour necrosis factor signaling pathways associated with cytotoxicity and resistance to taxanes in tumour cells.
(Submitter supplied) The taxanes are widely used in the treatment of breast and other cancers.  While their cytotoxicity has been attributed to the induction of cell cycle arrest in mitosis through the stabilization of microtubules, we found that docetaxel promotes soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha production in MCF-7 breast tumor cells.  TNF-alpha induces apoptotic cell death in a variety of cell types by binding to one of its receptors (TNFR1) which promotes death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) formation. more...

618. MMTV-Myc tumor development in E2F-null backgrounds
(Submitter supplied) Advances in genomic signatures have begun to dissect breast cancer heterogeneity, and application of these signatures will allow the prediction of which pathways are important in tumor development.  Here we used genomic signatures to predict involvement of specific E2F transcription factors in Myc-induced tumors.  We genetically tested this prediction by interbreeding Myc transgenics with mice lacking various activator E2F alleles. more...

621. Integration of BRCA1-mediated miRNA and mRNA signatures reveal miR-146a, miR-99b and miR-205 regulation of the TRAF2 and NFkB pathways (mRNA dataset)
(Submitter supplied) BRCA1 deregulation is a frequent event in the pathogenesis of breast as well as other cancers. In addition to the DNA repair functions of BRCA1, it is involved in a wide range of cellular processes such as cell cycle, chromatin remodeling or transcription. However, the molecular events underlying BRCA1-associated tumorigenesis are still largely unknown. In order to deepen our understanding of BRCA1-associated tumorigenesis, we integrated data from mRNA and miRNA microarray experiments on the HCC1937 breast cancer cell line, and the isogenic HCC1937 stably expressing BRCA1, to obtain significant miRNA-mRNA relationships associated to the presence of the BRCA1 gene. more...

622. Gene expression profile of NR2E3 in MCF7 cells
(Submitter supplied) While the roles of individual nuclear receptor (NR) in human diseases have been well characterized, interplays among NRs have not been extensively characterized due, in part, to technical difficulties in simultaneously monitoring molecular activities of all 48 NR genes. Using systems-level analysis of publically available gene expression data from NCI-60 cell lines, we uncovered novel interaction between ESR1 and orphan receptor NR2E3. more...

623. Cooperativity of Rb, Brca1, and p53 and malignant breast cancer evolution
(Submitter supplied) Breast cancers that are “triple-negative” for the clinical markers ESR1, PGR, and HER2 typically belong to the Basal-like molecular subtype. Defective Rb, p53, and Brca1 pathways are each associated with triple-negative and Basal-like subtypes. Our mouse genetic studies demonstrate that the combined inactivation of Rb and p53 pathways is sufficient to suppress the physiological cell death of mammary involution. more...

624. CHAC1 mRNA expression is a strong prognostic biomarker in breast and ovarian cancer
(Submitter supplied) Extracellular, cancer-specific methylated DNA has been shown to be a prognostic marker when detected in serum or plasma. In this study we investigated the effect of treating cancer cells with differentially methylated CpG DNA. When breast cancer cell lines were treated with methylated CpG DNA, a consistent upregulation of CHAC1 mRNA expression was observed. CHAC1 was recently described to be a novel component of the unfolded protein response pathway. more...

(Submitter supplied) Activation of inflammatory pathways is one plausible mechanism underlying the association between obesity and increased breast cancer risk. However, macrophage infiltration and local biomarkers of inflammation in breast adipose tissue have seldom been studied in association with obesity. Gene expression profiles of normal breast tissue from reduction mammoplasty patients were evaluated by whole genome microarrays to identify patterns associated with obesity status (normal-weight, body mass index (BMI) <25; overweight, BMI 25-29.9; obese, BMI > or equal to 30). more...

(Submitter supplied) Fluorine-18-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) is widely used as positron-emission-tomography (PET) radiotracer for the detection and staging of human cancer. Tumor uptake of FDG varies substantially between different cancer types and between patients with the same tumor type. The molecular basis for this heterogeneity is unknown. Using cancer cell lines and primary human tumors of distinct histologic origins, we here show that increased FDG uptake is universally associated with coordinate upregulation of genes within the glycolysis, pentose-phosphate, and other related metabolic pathways. more...

635. Methylation specifies distinct estrogen-induced binding site repertoires of CBP to chromatin (mRNA)
(Submitter supplied) Multiple signaling pathways ultimately modulate the epigenetic information embedded in the chromatin of gene promoters by recruiting epigenetic enzymes. We found that, in estrogen-regulated gene programming, the acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein (CBP) is specifically and exclusively methylated by the coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase (CARM1) in vivo. CARM1-dependent CBP methylation and p160 coactivators were required for estrogen-induced recruitment to chromatin targets. more...

636. A new gene expression signature, the ClinicoMolecular Triad Classification, may improve prediction and prognostication of breast cancer at the time of diagnosis

None of the currently available gene signatures correlates to this clinical classification. We aimed to develop a test that is practical for the oncologists, that offers both molecular characterization of BCs, and improved prediction of prognosis and treatment response. more...

(Submitter supplied) Background: Cancer stem cells are presumed to have virtually unlimited proliferative and self-renewal abilities and to be highly resistant to chemotherapy, a feature that is associated with overexpression of ATP-binding cassette transporters. We investigated whether prolonged continuous selection of cells for drug resistance enriches cultures for cancer stem-like cells. Methods: Cancer stem cells were defined as CD44+/CD24– cells that could self-renew (ie, generate cells with the tumorigenic CD44+/CD24– phenotype), differentiate, invade, and form tumors in vivo. more...

639. Two types of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and -negative (ER-) breast cancer will be compared with glycan structure analyses
(Submitter supplied) ER+ve and ER-ve breast cancers tend to show different patterns of metastasis, with ER+ve tumours having a propensity to metastasize to the bone while ER-ve tumours tend to induce visceral metastasis. Glycans can play an important role in metastasis through their interactions with glycan binding proteins. Moreover we, and others have also shown that expression of particular tumor-associated glycoforms of the mucin MUC1, allows it to interact with lectins of the immune system. more...

(Submitter supplied) Despite the role of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) pathway as a key growth driver for breast cells, the phenotypic consequence of exogenous introduction of ERalpha into ERalpha-negative cells paradoxically has been growth inhibition. We map the binding profiles of ERalpha and its interacting transcription factors (TFs), FOXA1 and GATA3, in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. We observe that these three TFs form a functional enhanceosome and cooperatively modulate the transcriptional networks previously ascribed to ERalpha alone. more...

648. Formalin Fixation at Low Temperature Better Preserves Nucleic Acid Integrity
(Submitter supplied) INTRODUCTION. Fixation with formalin, a widely adopted procedure to preserve tissue samples, leads to extensive degradation of nucleic acids and thereby compromises procedures like microarray-based gene expression profiling. We hypothesized that RNA fragmentation is caused by activation of RNAses during the interval between formalin penetration and tissue fixation. To prevent RNAse activation, a series of tissue samples were kept under-vacuum at 4°C until fixation and then fixed at 4°C, for 24 hours, in formalin followed by 4 hours in ethanol 95%. more...

649. Cellular reprogramming by the conjoint action of ERalpha, FOXA1, and GATA3 to a ligand inducible growth state
(Submitter supplied) Despite the role of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) pathway as a key growth driver for breast cells, the phenotypic consequence of exogenous introduction of ERalpha into ERalpha-negative cells paradoxically has been growth inhibition. We map the binding profiles of ERalpha and its interacting transcription factors (TFs), FOXA1 and GATA3 in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. We observe that these three TFs form a functional enhanceosome and cooperatively modulate the transcriptional networks previously ascribed to ERalpha alone. more...

659. Investigate the anti-tumor mechanisms of But4ManNAc and butyrate in two breast cancer cell lines
(Submitter supplied) But4ManNAc - an analog of ManNAc, the committed precursor of sialic acid - decreases metastatic potential, inhibits growth, and triggers apoptosis in many cancer cells. The anti-tumor effects of But4ManNAc may result from a synergistic interaction between butyrate-induced changes in gene expression and ManNAc-induced altered sialylation.  This experiment provides insight into synergistic interactions by identifying changes in gene expression specific to But4ManNAc and not shared with butyrate.

662. Proteolytic inactivation of the autoinhibitory prodomain is essential for the pro-tumorigenic function of membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP)
(Submitter supplied) Invasive cancers employ pericellular proteolysis to breach the extracellular matrix and basement membrane barriers and invade the surrounding tissue. Pro-invasive, pro-tumorigenic MT1-MMP is the primary mediator of proteolytic events on the cancer cell surface. Cellular MT1-MMP is synthesized as a latent zymogen. The latency of MT1-MMP is maintained by its N-terminal inhibitory prodomain. Our study reveals a critical mechanism underlying the activation pathway and subsequent execution of the tumor-promoting function of MT1-MMP. more...

683. Genomic Collaboration of Estrogen Receptor-α and ERK2 in Regulating Gene and Proliferation Programs
(Submitter supplied) The nuclear hormone receptor, estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα), and MAP kinases both play key roles in hormone-dependent cancers, yet their interplay and the integration of their signaling inputs remain poorly understood. In these studies, we document that estrogen-occupied ERα activates and interacts with ERK2, a downstream effector in the MAPK pathway, resulting in ERK2 and ERα colocalization at chromatin binding sites across the genome of breast cancer cells. more...

684. Tissue-type specific estrogen signaling in breast and uterine cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) Estrogen receptors play critical roles in both the normal physiological, and disease states of numerous tissues, including breast and uterus. Estrogen receptor alpha (ER) can activate or repress the expression of target genes upon estrogen stimulation. In order to better understand the transcriptional network of ER in breast  and uterus, we generated genome wide maps of  ER binding sites (ERBS) and gene expression profiles in breast cancer cells (MCF7 and T47D) and uterine cancer cells (ECC1 and Ishikawa) through ChIP-Seq and microarray techniques. more...

(Submitter supplied) HER2 targeting with trastuzumab has changed the prognosis of breast cancer patients carrying amplification and/or overexpression of this oncogene. Despite this progress, however, resistance to trastuzumab occurs in the vast majority of patients. Newer anti-HER2 therapies, like the dual tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) lapatinib, show antitumor activity in a limited proportion of patients, indicating that HER2 can be still exploited as a target after trastuzumab failure. more...

721. Time-dependent expressed markers and their characterization for premature senescence induced by ionizing radiation in MCF7
(Submitter supplied) Recently, senescence has been suggested as a defense mechanism to block sporadic induction of cancer cells. Radiation treatment induces proliferating cancer cells to turn into non-proliferating senescent cells in vitro. To characterize transcriptional reprogramming after radiation treatment, we measured the gene expression profiles of MCF7 at different time points after treatment. In these experiments, we found that IR induced premature senescence in MCF7 cells, and IR treatment resulted in significant changes in the expression of 305 marker genes (less than 1% FDR), which were strongly correlated (|r|>0.9) with IR treatment in a time-dependent manner. more...

722. Exon-level transcriptome profiling in murine breast cancer reveals splicing changes specific to tumors with different metastatic abilities
(Submitter supplied) BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the second most frequent type of cancer affecting women. We are increasingly aware that changes in mRNA splicing are associated with various characteristics of cancer. The most deadly aspect of cancer is metastasis, the process by which cancer spreads from the primary tumor to distant organs. However, little is known specifically about the involvement of alternative splicing in the formation of macroscopic metastases. more...

Pathways that regulate metastasis enhancement and suppression both contribute to tumor dissemination process. In order to identify novel metastasis suppressors, we set up a forward genetic screen in a mouse model. We transduced a genome-wide RNAi library into the non-metastatic 168FARN breast cancer cell line, orthotopically transplanted the cells into mouse mammary fat pads, and then selected for cells that could metastasize to the lung and identified an RNAi for the KLF17 gene. more...

756. Functional characterization of E- and P-cadherin in invasive breast cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) Alterations in the cadherin-catenin adhesion complexes are involved in tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. However, the functional implication of distinct cadherin types in breast cancer biology is still poorly understood. Methods: To compare the functional role of E-cadherin and P-cadherin in invasive breast cancer, we stably transfected these molecules into the MDA-MB-231 cell line, and investigated their effects on motility, invasion and gene expression regulation. more...

(Submitter supplied) Under current models for signal-dependent transcription in eukaryotes, DNA-binding activator proteins regulate the recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to a set of target promoters.  Yet, recent studies, as well as our results herein, show that Pol II is widely distributed (i.e., "preloaded") at the promoters of many genes prior to specific signaling events.  How Pol II recruitment and Pol II preloading fit within a unified model of gene regulation is unclear. more...

764. Synergy between plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and Snail in tumoral migration 
(Submitter supplied) Snail, a family of transcriptional repressors implicated in cell movement, has been correlated with tumour invasivity. The Plasminogen Activation system (PAs), including urokinase (uPA), its receptor (uPAR), and its inhibitor (PAI-1), also plays a key role in cancer invasion and metastasis, either through proteolytic degradation or by non proteolytic modulation of cell adhesion and migration. Thus, Snail and PAs both influence those processes and are over-expressed in cancers. more...

HSD17B12 expression was reported in breast carcinomas but its functions have remained unknown. Therefore, we examined the correlation between mRNA expression profiles determined by microarray analysis and tissue E2 concentrations obtained from 16 postmenopausal breast carcinoma cases in order to analyze an association of the enzyme expression with intratumoral E2 production. more...

766. Identification of transcriptional changes induced by FHIT in lung cancer cells NCI-H460
(Submitter supplied) The FHIT gene, at 3p14.2, encompasses the common fragile site FRA3B and is frequently inactivated in primary tumors and cell lines of lung, head and neck, stomach, esophagus, cervix and breast cancer. In particular, loss of the FHIT protein is one of the most frequent alteration in lung tumors and pre-invasive lung lesions, suggesting a role for this gene in the early stages of lung carcinogenesis. Adenoviral-mediated restoration of FHIT expression in FHIT-negative cell lines results in cell cycle alteration, induction of apoptosis (through activation of the cytoplasmic apoptotic pathway) and regression of the tumorigenic phenotype. Taken together these observations support the hypothesis of a role for FHIT in human carcinogenesis, but little is known about its mechanism of action. Identification of transcriptional targets of FHIT is therefore critical to understand the pathways by which FHIT promotes growth arrest and apoptosis.

We hypothesized that the breast epithelium at risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers harbors mammary epithelial cells (MECs) with altered proliferation and differentiation properties. Microarray studies revealed that PMEC colonies from BRCA1 mutation carriers anticipate expression profiles found in BRCA1-related tumors, and that the EGFR pathway is upregulated in BRCA1 mutation carriers compared ton non BRCA1 mutation carriers. more...

Importantly, Rho overexpression is frequently seen in many carcinomas. However, published studies have almost invariably utilized immortal or tumorigenic cell lines to study Rho GTPase functions and there are no studies on the potential of Rho small GTPase to overcome senescence checkpoints and induce preneoplastic transformation of human mammary epithelial cells (hMECs). more...

795. cDNA microarray profiles of canine mammary tumour cell lines reveal deregulated pathways pertaining to their phenotype
(Submitter supplied) Mammary cancer is the most common type of cancer in female dogs with a lifetime risk of over 24% when dogs are not spayed. The elucidation of the complete canine genome opens new areas for development of cancer therapies. These should be tested first by in vitro models such as cell lines. However, to date, no canine mammary cell lines have been characterized by expression profiling. In this study, canine mammary tumour cell lines with histologically distinct primary tumours of origin were characterized using a newly developed canine cDNA microarray. more...

These were associated with different clinical outcomes. However, although the basal and the ErbB2 subtypes are repeatedly recognized, identification of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive subtypes has been inconsistent. Refinement of their molecular definition is therefore needed. more...

803. Dietary effect of SPI or Genistein alters rat mammary epithelial global gene expression profiles 
(Submitter supplied) The role of diet in the prevention of breast cancer is widely accepted, yet little is known on how early dietary effects mitigate adult cancer risk. Soy consumption is associated with reduced breast cancer risk in women, an effect largely attributed to the soy isoflavone genistein (GEN). We previously showed lower chemically-induced mammary tumor incidence in young adult rats with lifetime dietary intake of soy protein isolate (SPI), a highly refined soy product in infant formula, than in those fed the control diet Casein (CAS). more...
