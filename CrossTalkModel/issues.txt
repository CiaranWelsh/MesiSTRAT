Issues with current model
=========================

pAkt
-----
- 
	
pErk
-----

pS6K
----
- Under MK2206 pretreatment, the amount of predicted S6K
  phos in response to TGFb decreases with length of pretreatment time
- This is true for both Everolimus + MK and MK only conditions, though lowers
  in magnitude for Everolimus conditions. 
- This behaviour is not predicted by the experimental data for MK/MK+EV




pSmad2
-------
- Everolimus pretreatment enhances TGFb-mediated phos of Smad2
- AZD pretreatment also enhances TGFb-mediated phos of Smad2
	- Thus this must be by a different mechanism
- When Everolimus and AZD are added together there is a small synergistic 
  effect, specifically in the second two bars (compare E_A_1.25 Vs A_1.25 and E_A_48 Vs A_48). 
  - However, it appears there is a non-linearity as maximal level of phos may be saturating (looking at E_A_48, E_A_72, A_48 and A_72)
  
Some questions
--------------
1) How does Everolimus increase TGFb-mediated phos of Smad2? 
2) How does AZD increase TGFb-mediated phos of Smad2? 
3) How do Everolimus and AZD synergise in the increase TGFb-mediated Smad2 phos? 

Hypothesis 1: Akt phosphorylates an intermediate which leads to increase in Smad2 phos
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) If this is the mechanism then Everolimus phos Smad2 by increasing pAkt by inhibiting the S6K FB. 
2) In which case, AZD inhibits Mek, which inhibits Erk which causes dephos of PI3K
   which lowers Akt phos and therefore Smad2 phosphorylation!
   - i.e. this hypothesis leads me to predict Smad2 would be dephosphorylated by AZD
   - This prediction is reflected in current simulations
3) Because of point 2), this hypothesis does not lend itself to synergy between AZD and Everolimus 
   mechanism of enhanced TGFb-mediated Smad2 phos 

- It may be that the links between MAPK and PI3K are not accurately represented, in which case
  this can still be the correct hypothesis. For instance, removing the dephos reaction by ppErk 
  may help with reproducing the Smad2 behaviour. But at present, this reaction is responsible for 
  being able to fit the pErk data for Everolimus
	
Hypothesis 2: Erk phosphorylates an intermediate which leads to increase in Smad2 phos
======================================================================================
1) Everolimus enhances pPI3K phos which phos Raf then Mek and Erk. Increased Erk increases pSmad2. 
2) Inhibition of Mek leads to reduced Erk phos and subsequently would reduce Smad2 phos. 
3) Similar to hypothesis 1, because of point 2) this hypothesis does not lend itself to the idea of 
   synergy between AZD and Everolimus mechanisms. 
   
Hypothesis 3: Both pAkt and pErk are capable of independently phosphorylating Smad2
===================================================================================
1) Everolimus enhances Akt phosphorylation. Akt phosphorylation increases Smad2 phosphorylation.
	- Smad2 phosphorylation would be subsidised by the mechanism in hypothesis 2, point 1. 
2) AZD inhibits Mek phos leading to less Erk phos, causing less phosphorylation of Smad2
3) same as for hypothesis 2, point 3.

Hypothesis 4: pAkt leads to pSmad2 phosphorylation while pErk leads to inhibition of pSmad2 phos. 
=================================================================================================
1) Same as Hypothesis 1, point 1.
2) 
	i)	AZD inihbits Mek which inhibits Erk which increases Smad2 phos, by disinhibition. 
	ii)	AZD inihbits Mek which inhibits Erk which increases inhibitor of Smad2 phos
	
	- We would not be able to distinguish between this level of detail in the mechanism with this data/model pair. 
	
3) It looks like mechanisms 1 and 2 would synergise. 










Because we have so many conditions, some of which need to be simulated with events, 
I find it diffict to ma pthe experimental to simulated variables. 

consequently its hard to use full parameter estimation procedures, as implemented in COPASI. 

This does not preclude the implementation of a parameter estimation algorithm myself, but	
	- this will not be as good as preexisting ones
	- will take time to develop
	- will be very slow
	- Will only be a local method, since global method will take more time and understanding
	
If I can't see a way to use parameter estimation, then I'm also unsure as to how we can rigerously 
rule out specific topologies. An alternative is to try this by eye. 

For instance, the topology 2 has been falsified by S6K under MK condition.

Is there any scope for changing the shape of the paper such that the model is used, not to 
disprove other hypotheses, but to provide the most feasible explaination 



Bottom line

I haven't built all these models because quite frankly its a lot of 
work just to fiddle the parameters for a single model. 6 would probably take
me a long time - It is better to think a little more about the network structure
before diving further into the modelling.
