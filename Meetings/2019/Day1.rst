Day 1
=====

Kathrin
---------
- Breast cancer intro. Prevalence, 80% ER+, resistance, rational etc.
- MESI-STRAT
	- 14 partners, 7 countries. 
- Targeting metabolic signalling in ER+ berast cancer
- A bottom up approach to look at the interplay between metabolism, signalling and endocrine therapies. 
- Guide decision mkaing during endocrine therapy. 
- The difficulty is that the tissue is onlhy available at therapy onset. 
	- So how to make decisions at later stages? 
- Understanding the interplay between tumour metabolism and signalling, we want to be able to predict the response to therapy
- second goal, to look at tumour metabolism itself as a drug target. 
- Use computational models to predict the tumour response to drugs and validate experimentally. 
- Where is obergurgl?
	- Might be worth staying just for this =]

Christiana Opitz
----------------
- WP6: clinical trials
- Split into 2 work packages
- Analysis of patient samples, no intervention. 
- Can I do a two way profile likelihood? Get a profile likelihood surface? 
- Interaction between tryptophan and immune cells. 
- Perfusion based boioreactors for the culture of vreast cancer tissue. 
	- cultivation of breast cancer tissue for up to 3 weeks
	- ER- will not grow, but ER+ will not. However in this experimental setup, ER+ grow as well. 
- Trial no. 1
	- Clinical trials. WP6,
	- Non-interventoal trials. 
	- trial 1
		- risk detection trial
		- biological fluids of ER+ BC cells at *diagnosis*
		- Discriminate patient populations
	- trial 2:
		- Measure merker panels in serum. Discrimination between relapse vs stable disease
		- Measured at relapse. 
		- Patients progress analysed. Group patients. 
	- trial 3:
		- Relapse prediction trial. 
		- Selectiono f samples from patients with relapse vs stable disease during follow up. 
	- MEasure a broad panel of biomarkers
	- Samples snap frozen to prevent bias
	- Metabolimic tech? 	
		- Using Mass spec, ELISAs, 
	- measure biomarkers in bc patients, before during and after therapy. 

Tobias Anzeneder
----------------
- WP1, 6, 7
- provides biobanked samples and collect longitudinal clinical samples and annotated datasets
- ET termination trial
- PATH biobank contributes towards 4 studies. 
- clinical trial stuff...

Christiana again
----------------
- Anastrozole treatment, once daily for 21 days
	- targets estrogen pathway
- intervention validaiton trials
- clinical validation of predictive meso medels and marker panels in patients at relapse and folliwing targeted drug niterventions. 


Mathias Zeigler
---------------
- Characterisation of metabolic networks in breast cancer
- tryptophan metabolites
	- established the measurement of try metabolites in blood and urine (HPLC, GC/LC-MS, 
	- ELISA
- Development of IVD assay
- Antibodies are being made for some small molecules
- Quinolinic acid, kynuranic acid,  
- Measuring NAD turnover in human cells.
    - label with heavy carbon $C^{13}$
    - half-life ~5h
-



Adreas Raue
------------
- Modelling tools for signalling and pharmacology models
- Andreas offering support on methods
- d2d (obviously)
    - Likelihood waterfalls (likelihood ranks)
    - Likelihood profiles
-



Day 2
=====
- Stuff about time line, financial reports.
- Fill out templates for work-action plan of some variety...
-
